# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data science and machine learning. This project demonstrates how to implement PCA without relying on pre-built libraries, providing insight into the algorithm's core mechanics.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Covariance matrix calculation
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector computation
- Dimensionality reduction
- Visualization of results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `PrincipalComponentAnalysis.ipynb`
3. Run the cells to see the step-by-step PCA implementation
